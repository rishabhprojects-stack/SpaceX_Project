# **SpaceX  Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction**

## Hands-on Lab: Complete the EDA with Visualization

Estimated time needed: **70** minutes

In this assignment, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is due to the fact that SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

In this lab, you will perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering.

Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully

Several examples of an unsuccessful landing are shown here:

![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/api/Images/crash.gif)

Most unsuccessful landings are planned. Space X performs a controlled landing in the oceans.

## Objectives
Perform exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering using `Pandas` and `Matplotlib`

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- PreparingÂ Data  Feature Engineering

"""### Import Libraries and Define Auxiliary Functions

We will import the following libraries the lab
"""

# andas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
import pandas as pd
#NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
import numpy as np
# Matplotlib is a plotting library for python and pyplot gives us a MatLab like plotting framework. We will use this in our plotter function to plot data.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics

"""## Exploratory Data Analysis

First, let's read the SpaceX dataset into a Pandas dataframe and print its summary

"""First, let's try to see how the `FlightNumber` (indicating the continuous launch attempts.) and `Payload` variables would affect the launch outcome.

We can plot out the <code>FlightNumber</code> vs. <code>PayloadMass</code>and overlay the outcome of the launch. We see that as the flight number increases, the first stage is more likely to land successfully. The payload mass is also important; it seems the more massive the payload, the less likely the first stage will return.

"""Next, let's drill down to each site visualize its detailed launch records.

### TASK 1: Visualize the relationship between Flight Number and Launch Site

Use the function <code>catplot</code> to plot <code>FlightNumber</code> vs <code>LaunchSite</code>, set the  parameter <code>x</code>  parameter to <code>FlightNumber</code>,set the  <code>y</code> to <code>Launch Site</code> and set the parameter <code>hue</code> to <code>'class'</code>

Next, we want to visually check if there are any relationship between success rate and orbit type.

However for GTO we cannot distinguish this well as both positive landing rate and negative landing(unsuccessful mission) are both there here.

### TASK  6: Visualize the launch success yearly trend

You can plot a line chart with x axis to be <code>Year</code> and y axis to be average success rate, to get the average launch success trend.

The function will help you get the year from the date:

By now, you should obtain some preliminary insights about how each important variable would affect the success rate, we will select the features that will be used in success prediction in the future module.

Use the function <code>get_dummies</code> and <code>features</code> dataframe to apply OneHotEncoder to the column <code>Orbits</code>, <code>LaunchSite</code>, <code>LandingPad</code>, and <code>Serial</code>.
