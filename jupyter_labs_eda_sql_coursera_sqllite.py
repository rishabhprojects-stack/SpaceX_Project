<h1 align=center><font size = 5>Assignment: SQL Notebook for Peer Assignment</font></h1>

Estimated time needed: **60** minutes.

## Introduction
Using this Python notebook you will:

1.  Understand the Spacex DataSet
2.  Load the dataset  into the corresponding table in a Db2 database
3.  Execute SQL queries to answer assignment questions

## Overview of the DataSet

SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones.

It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010.
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars wheras other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage.


Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.

This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This dataset includes a record for each payload carried during a SpaceX mission into outer space.

### Download the datasets

This assignment requires you to load the spacex dataset.

In many cases the dataset to be analyzed is available as a .CSV (comma separated values) file, perhaps on the internet. Click on the link below to download and save the dataset (.CSV file):

"""### Connect to the database

Let us first load the SQL extension and establish a connection with the database

"""## Tasks

Now write and execute SQL queries to solve the assignment tasks.

**Note: If the column names are in mixed case enclose it in double quotes
   For Example "Landing_Outcome"**

### Task 1




##### Display the names of the unique launch sites  in the space mission

"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# %sql SELECT DISTINCT Launch_Site FROM SPACEXTABLE;

"""
### Task 2


#####  Display 5 records where launch sites begin with the string 'CCA'
"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# %sql select * from SPACEXTABLE where Launch_Site like 'CCA%' limit 5;

"""### Task 3




##### Display the total payload mass carried by boosters launched by NASA (CRS)

"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# %sql select sum(PAYLOAD_MASS__KG_) from SPACEXTABLE where Customer = 'NASA (CRS)'

"""### Task 4




##### Display average payload mass carried by booster version F9 v1.1

"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# %sql select avg(PAYLOAD_MASS__KG_) from SPACEXTABLE where Booster_Version like 'F9 v1.1%'

"""### Task 5

##### List the date when the first succesful landing outcome in ground pad was acheived.


_Hint:Use min function_

"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# %sql select min(DATE) from SPACEXTABLE where Landing_Outcome = 'Success (ground pad)'

"""### Task 6

##### List the names of the boosters which have success in drone ship and have payload mass greater than 4000 but less than 6000

"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# %sql select Booster_Version from SPACEXTABLE where Landing_Outcome = 'Success (drone ship)' and PAYLOAD_MASS__KG_ between 4000 and 6000

"""### Task 7




##### List the total number of successful and failure mission outcomes

"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# %sql select Mission_Outcome, count(*) from SPACEXTABLE group by Mission_Outcome

"""### Task 8



##### List all the booster_versions that have carried the maximum payload mass, using a subquery with a suitable aggregate function.

"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# %sql select Booster_Version from SPACEXTABLE where PAYLOAD_MASS__KG_=(select max(PAYLOAD_MASS__KG_) from SPACEXTABLE)

"""### Task 9


##### List the records which will display the month names, failure landing_outcomes in drone ship ,booster versions, launch_site for the months in year 2015.

**Note: SQLLite does not support monthnames. So you need to use  substr(Date, 6,2) as month to get the months and substr(Date,0,5)='2015' for year.**

"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# %sql select SUBSTR(DATE, 6, 2) as Month, Landing_Outcome, Booster_Version, Launch_Site from SPACEXTABLE where Landing_Outcome = 'Failure (drone ship)' and SUBSTR(DATE, 0, 5) = '2015'

"""### Task 10




##### Rank the count of landing outcomes (such as Failure (drone ship) or Success (ground pad)) between the date 2010-06-04 and 2017-03-20, in descending order.

"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
