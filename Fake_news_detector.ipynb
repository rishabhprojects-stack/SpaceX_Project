The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Police fired tear gas on Thursday at the protesting students. Video footage posted on social media later in the day showed uniformed officers outside dormitories and inside classrooms using batons to hit people who did not appear to be involved in the campus protests.  It was the latest crackdown by police on protests since an Aug. 8 presidential election that was later annulled by the Supreme Court. A re-run of the vote has been set for Oct. 26. The Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA)  this morning noted from social media reports of an incident in which members of the National Police Service allegedly stormed the University of Nairobi and assaulted students at the institution,  the authority said on its Twitter feed.  It requested that any member of the public come forward to provide information to aid the investigation.  The students had been protesting against the re-arrest of a lawmaker, Paul Ongili Owino, on Wednesday, shortly after he was released on bail on charges of subversion for calling President Uhuru Kenyatta a  son of a dog  at a campaign rally. Kenya is a key Western ally in a region often roiled by violence. Preparations for the re-run of the election are being closely monitored for signs of instability, after at least 28 people were killed in unrest following the Aug. 8 vote. The IPOA watchdog was created in 2011, after police came under severe criticism for the number of protesters killed during demonstrations against disputed elections in 2007. The violence then killed around 1,2000 people. But local and international rights groups say the institution is struggling to fulfill its mandate to investigate allegations of police brutality in a country rife with reports from civilians of extrajudicial killings by security forces.  The IPOA has secured two convictions of police officers in the four years it has been operational. The watchdog pledged last month to fast-track investigations into high-profile deaths such as that of a baby allegedly killed by police in the violence after the election. [L4N1L34FC] But people familiar with the status of these investigations say the police are not cooperating with them, and that senior officials in the police force and the interior ministry insist officers killed only thieves and thugs. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON/CAIRO (Reuters) - Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an EgyptAir flight from Cairo to New York on Saturday after President Donald Trump halted the entry of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, sources at Cairo airport said. The passengers, arriving in transit to Cairo airport, were stopped and re-directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas, the sources said.  Trump on Friday put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries, saying the moves would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. He said his most sweeping use of his presidential powers since taking office a week ago, barring travelers from the seven nations for at least 90 days, would give his administration time to develop more stringent screening procedures for refugees, immigrants and visitors. \\u201cI\\u2019m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Don\\u2019t want them here,\\u201d Trump said earlier on Friday at the Pentagon. \\u201cWe only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,\\u201d he said. The bans, though temporary, took effect immediately, causing havoc and confusion for would-be travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Besides Cairo it was not immediately clear whether other  airports of countries listed by Trump had swiftly implemented the ban. Arab officials of the listed countries would not comment on the matter. The order seeks to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution, a move Trump separately said was aimed at helping Christians in Syria. That led some legal experts to question whether the order was constitutional. One group said it would announce a court challenge on Monday. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said the order targets Muslims because of their faith, contravening the U.S. Constitutional right to freedom of religion. \\u201cPresident Trump has cloaked what is a discriminatory ban against nationals of Muslim countries under the banner of national security,\\u201d said Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.  Trump has long pledged to take this kind of action, making it a prominent feature of his campaign for the Nov. 8 election. But people who work with Muslim immigrants and refugees were scrambling to determine the scope of the order. Even legal permanent residents - people with \\u201cgreen cards\\u201d allowing them to live and work in the United States - were being advised to consult immigration lawyers before traveling outside the country, or trying to return, according to Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group in Washington.  On Friday evening, Abed Ayoub of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said he had fielded about 100 queries from people anxious about the order, which he said he believed could affect traveling green card holders, students, people coming to the United States for medical care and others. \\u201cIt\\u2019s chaos,\\u201d Ayoub said. During his campaign, Trump tapped into American fears about Islamic State militants and the flood of migrants into Europe from Syria\\u2019s civil war, saying refugees could be a \\u201cTrojan horse\\u201d that allowed attackers to enter the United States. In December 2015, he called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, drawing fire for suggesting a religious test for immigrants that critics said would violate the U.S. Constitution. His idea later evolved into a proposal for \\u201cextreme vetting.\\u201d  Trump\\u2019s order also suspends the Syrian refugee program until further notice, and will eventually give priority to minority religious groups fleeing persecution.  Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network that the exception would help Syrian Christians fleeing the civil war there. Legal experts were divided on whether this order would be constitutional. \\u201cIf they are thinking about an exception for Christians, in almost any other legal context discriminating in favor of one religion and against another religion could violate the constitution,\\u201d said Stephen Legomsky, a former chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration. But Peter Spiro, a professor at Temple University Beasley School of Law, said Trump\\u2019s action would likely be constitutional because the president and Congress are allowed considerable deference when it comes to asylum decisions. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a completely plausible prioritization, to the extent this group is actually being persecuted,\\u201d Spiro said. The order may also affect special refugee programs for Iraqis who worked for the U.S. government as translators after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It is already affecting refugees and their families, said Jen Smyers of the Church World Service, a Protestant faith-based group that works with migrants. Smyers said she spoke to an Iraqi mother whose twin daughters remain in Iraq due to processing delays. \\u201cThose two 18-year-old daughters won\\u2019t be able to join their mother in the U.S.,\\u201d she said. Democrats on Friday were quick to condemn Trump\\u2019s order as un-American, saying it would tarnish the reputation of the United States as a land that welcomes immigrants. \\u201cToday\\u2019s executive order from President Trump is more about extreme xenophobia than extreme vetting,\\u201d said Democratic Senator Edward Markey in a statement. Some Republicans praised the move. Representative Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, said Islamic State has threatened to use the U.S. immigration system, making it important to do more screening. \\u201cI am pleased that President Trump is using the tools granted to him by Congress and the power granted by the Constitution to help keep America safe and ensure we know who is entering the United States,\\u201d Goodlatte said in a statement. Without naming Trump, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday it was no time to build walls between nations and criticized steps towards cancelling world trade agreements. Trump on Wednesday ordered the construction of a U.S.-Mexican border wall, a major promise during his election campaign, as part of a package of measures to curb illegal immigration. \\u201cToday is not the time to erect walls between nations. They have forgotten that the Berlin wall fell years ago,\\u201d Rouhani said in a speech carried live on Iranian state television. He made no direct reference to Trump\\u2019s order regarding refugees and travelers from the seven mainly Muslim states. Rouhani, a pragmatist elected in 2013, thawed Iran\\u2019s relations with world powers after years of confrontation and engineered its 2015 deal with them under which it curbed its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions. Rouhani said earlier this month that Trump could not unilaterally cancel the nuclear deal and that talk of renegotiating it was \\u201cmeaningless\\u201d. France and Germany voiced disquiet on Saturday over Trump\\u2019s new restrictions on immigration. \\u201cWelcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty,\\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said at a joint news conference with German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel. \\u201cThe United States is a country where Christian traditions have an important meaning. Loving your neighbor is a major Christian value, and that includes helping people,\\u201d said  Gabriel. \\u201cI think that is what unites us in the West, and I think that is what we want to make clear to the Americans.\\u201d \",\n          \"PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo s center-right coalition led by the Democratic Party of Kosovo signed a deal on Monday with the small New Alliance for Kosovo party to form a government, ending nearly three months of political deadlock after an election on June 11.      Finally Kosovo has started to move ... we had some big delays and our institutions now will be formed,  said Ramush Haradinaj, from the center-right coalition of parties made up of former guerrillas who fought the 1998-99 war against Serb forces. Under the deal, the parties along with ethnic minorities will secure 63 seats in the 120-seat parliament.  President Hashim Thaci is expected to give Haradinaj a mandate to form the government within days. A source who asked not to be named told Reuters the parliament session to elect the parliament speaker would be held this week. Haradinaj, who twice stood trial before the United Nations war crimes court for war crimes and was acquitted, briefly held the post of prime minister in 2005.  The smaller New Alliance for Kosovo party is led by Behgjet Pacolli, who is dubbed by media the richest Kosovar.  Pacolli, who also holds a Swiss passport, won many contracts from the Russian government to rebuild state buildings in Moscow in the  90s but a decade ago he moved his business from Moscow to Kazakhstan.  It is unclear what post Pacolli will hold in the new government.  The new government will have to tackle unemployment running at 30 percent and improve relations with Kosovo s neighbors, especially Serbia, a precondition for both countries to move forward in the European Union accession process. It must also reform health and education and the tax administration system as well as include representatives of some 120,000 Kosovo Serbs who do not recognize independence. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, almost a decade after NATO air strikes drove out Serbian forces accused of expelling and killing ethnic Albanian civilians in a two-year counter-insurgency.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"October 6, 2016\",\n          \"June 10, 2017\",\n          \"Sep 13, 2015\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Earlier on Tuesday, Trump ordered a review of government procurement rules favoring American companies to see if they are actually benefiting, especially the U.S. steel industry. Trump\\u2019s executive order promises to properly police those provisions, but avoided detail about how that will happen.       Bill Hickey, president of Chicago-based Lapham-Hickey Steel, which has seven steel mills in the Midwest and Northeast, said he has heard talk of \\u201cBuy American\\u201d for decades, but American or foreign contractors frequently find loopholes to use imported steel.      \\u201cPoliticians all talk the same, but at the end of the day it just doesn\\u2019t work,\\u201d Hickey said, citing waivers to existing provisions.      Charles Bradford of Bradford Research said focusing on \\u201cBuy American\\u201d for U.S. steel does not take into account that some steel products - including tin plate and semi-finished products - are not made in the United States. So if enforced improperly, it could cause supply problems in a U.S. market in which up to 25 percent of steel was imported in the first quarter of this year.      \\u201cThe people who have pushed for this don\\u2019t have a clue and they don\\u2019t know math,\\u201d said Bradford. Cutting off the supply of goods not made in the United States would create fresh problems for U.S. companies, he said. In the construction industry, there also are concerns over \\u201ctoo strict a definition of what constitutes U.S.-made steel products,\\u201d said Kenneth Simonson, chief economist of the Associated General Contractors of America.  Simonson cited concerns with steel that might have been melted down from scrap metal that could have come from outside the United States, for example, and tracing its origins before that point. Trump\\u2019s White House track record so far also helps fuel skepticism inside the industry. Instead of bold action promised last year by then-candidate Trump on the North American Free Trade Agreement, on China, and free trade agreements, the new administration has \\u201cnot shown much evidence of doing so,\\u201d said KeyBanc Capital Markets steel analyst Philip Gibbs.     \\u201cI\\u2019m a lot less optimistic than I was three-and-a-half months ago because so far what I\\u2019ve seen coming out of the Trump administration is the same as the prior administration,\\u201d he added. As a result, Gibbs said investors should dial back expectations that Trump will do anything meaningful on trade, or on infrastructure which is where such an order could make a difference.  Investors seemed to shrug off Tuesday\\u2019s executive order.   Nucor Corp shares closed up 0.2 percent at $57.33, AK Steel Holding Corp gained a penny to end at $6.32 and United States Steel Corp closed down 0.5 percent at $28.73.      AK Steel did not respond to requests for comment. Nucor and U.S. Steel both welcomed the president\\u2019s executive order.     The move was welcomed by labor unions. The United Steelworkers said that under current practice, \\u201ccontractors often try to avoid the law through loopholes to buy cheap and often substandard foreign products like many from China.\\u201d Thomas Gibson, chief executive of lobby group the American Iron and Steel Institute, said in a statement that \\u201cBuy American\\u201d provisions \\u201care vital to the health of the domestic steel industry, and have helped create manufacturing jobs and build American infrastructure.\\u201d      Veteran steel industry analyst Michelle Applebaum said while it remains to be seen how thoroughly the Trump administration will police the steel industry, the executive order sends a clear message to steel importers.    \\u201cTrump has just created more risk for anyone who wants to import steel,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIf he puts money behind enforcement that will force people to play by the rules and that will be a good thing.\\u201d \",\n          \"(Reuters) - Former U.S. president George W. Bush has described the political climate in Washington as \\u201cpretty ugly\\u201d under Donald Trump\\u2019s presidency but expressed optimism the United States would pull through despite the divisive political discourse. \\u201cI don\\u2019t like the racism and I don\\u2019t like the name-calling and I don\\u2019t like the people feeling alienated,\\u201d Bush, 70, said in an interview with People magazine that will hit newsstands on Friday. \\u201cNobody likes that.\\u201d Promoting his first art book \\u201cPortraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief\\u2019s Tribute to America\\u2019s Warriors\\u201d, Bush said, however, that he felt no anxiety about the direction the country was headed in. \\u201cI\\u2019m optimistic about where we\\u2019ll end up,\\u201d Bush said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been through these periods before and we\\u2019ve always had a way to come out of it. I\\u2019m more optimistic than some.\\u201d     Trump, the first Republican president since Bush left office, won the November presidential election after beating 16 other candidates to the party\\u2019s nomination, including Bush\\u2019s brother Jeb. Prominent Republicans within the establishment wing of the party, including Bush and his father, former president George H.W. Bush, shunned him or offered tepid support. Bush diverged sharply from Trump\\u2019s new administration in a separate interview with NBC\\u2019s \\u201cToday\\u201d show on Monday, saying he supported a \\u201cwelcoming\\u201d immigration policy and praising the media as \\u201cindispensable to democracy,\\u201d during a wide-ranging interview with NBC\\u2019s \\u201cToday\\u201d show. [nL2N1GC0I1] Bush and his wife Laura spoke to People at their Dallas home. Proceeds from the book, a collection of portraits of wounded veterans, will help fund veterans\\u2019 health care and employment programs\\u00a0at the\\u00a0George W. Bush Presidential Center. The couple told the entertainment magazine that the center\\u2019s immigration ceremonies, reproductive-health programs for women in Africa and leadership training for Muslim women from the Middle East stand in contrast to Trump\\u2019s isolationism.  \\u201cThere\\u2019s\\u00a0a lot of ways to speak out,\\u201d he added. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s really through actions defending the values important to Laura and me. We\\u2019re a blessed nation, and we ought to help others.\\u201d Bush shrugged when People magazine asked if Trump\\u2019s immigration policies could threaten the center\\u2019s programs.   \\u201cNow that you mention it, it might bother me but we\\u2019ll figure out how to bring them over,\\u201d he said. \",\n          \"MOSCOW (Reuters) - There is no cooperation between Russia and U.S. on North Korea for the time being, the RIA news agency cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying on Saturday.  There is no cooperation so far. Only periodic exchanges of views,  he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump may meet at an Asian economic summit in Vietnam next week. Peskov said there was a  great probability  that the two would discuss the situation on the Korean peninsula if such a meeting was held. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Earlier on Tuesday, Trump ordered a review of government procurement rules favoring American companies to see if they are actually benefiting, especially the U.S. steel industry. Trump\\u2019s executive order promises to properly police those provisions, but avoided detail about how that will happen.       Bill Hickey, president of Chicago-based Lapham-Hickey Steel, which has seven steel mills in the Midwest and Northeast, said he has heard talk of \\u201cBuy American\\u201d for decades, but American or foreign contractors frequently find loopholes to use imported steel.      \\u201cPoliticians all talk the same, but at the end of the day it just doesn\\u2019t work,\\u201d Hickey said, citing waivers to existing provisions.      Charles Bradford of Bradford Research said focusing on \\u201cBuy American\\u201d for U.S. steel does not take into account that some steel products - including tin plate and semi-finished products - are not made in the United States. So if enforced improperly, it could cause supply problems in a U.S. market in which up to 25 percent of steel was imported in the first quarter of this year.      \\u201cThe people who have pushed for this don\\u2019t have a clue and they don\\u2019t know math,\\u201d said Bradford. Cutting off the supply of goods not made in the United States would create fresh problems for U.S. companies, he said. In the construction industry, there also are concerns over \\u201ctoo strict a definition of what constitutes U.S.-made steel products,\\u201d said Kenneth Simonson, chief economist of the Associated General Contractors of America.  Simonson cited concerns with steel that might have been melted down from scrap metal that could have come from outside the United States, for example, and tracing its origins before that point. Trump\\u2019s White House track record so far also helps fuel skepticism inside the industry. Instead of bold action promised last year by then-candidate Trump on the North American Free Trade Agreement, on China, and free trade agreements, the new administration has \\u201cnot shown much evidence of doing so,\\u201d said KeyBanc Capital Markets steel analyst Philip Gibbs.     \\u201cI\\u2019m a lot less optimistic than I was three-and-a-half months ago because so far what I\\u2019ve seen coming out of the Trump administration is the same as the prior administration,\\u201d he added. As a result, Gibbs said investors should dial back expectations that Trump will do anything meaningful on trade, or on infrastructure which is where such an order could make a difference.  Investors seemed to shrug off Tuesday\\u2019s executive order.   Nucor Corp shares closed up 0.2 percent at $57.33, AK Steel Holding Corp gained a penny to end at $6.32 and United States Steel Corp closed down 0.5 percent at $28.73.      AK Steel did not respond to requests for comment. Nucor and U.S. Steel both welcomed the president\\u2019s executive order.     The move was welcomed by labor unions. The United Steelworkers said that under current practice, \\u201ccontractors often try to avoid the law through loopholes to buy cheap and often substandard foreign products like many from China.\\u201d Thomas Gibson, chief executive of lobby group the American Iron and Steel Institute, said in a statement that \\u201cBuy American\\u201d provisions \\u201care vital to the health of the domestic steel industry, and have helped create manufacturing jobs and build American infrastructure.\\u201d      Veteran steel industry analyst Michelle Applebaum said while it remains to be seen how thoroughly the Trump administration will police the steel industry, the executive order sends a clear message to steel importers.    \\u201cTrump has just created more risk for anyone who wants to import steel,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIf he puts money behind enforcement that will force people to play by the rules and that will be a good thing.\\u201d \",\n          \"(Reuters) - Former U.S. president George W. Bush has described the political climate in Washington as \\u201cpretty ugly\\u201d under Donald Trump\\u2019s presidency but expressed optimism the United States would pull through despite the divisive political discourse. \\u201cI don\\u2019t like the racism and I don\\u2019t like the name-calling and I don\\u2019t like the people feeling alienated,\\u201d Bush, 70, said in an interview with People magazine that will hit newsstands on Friday. \\u201cNobody likes that.\\u201d Promoting his first art book \\u201cPortraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief\\u2019s Tribute to America\\u2019s Warriors\\u201d, Bush said, however, that he felt no anxiety about the direction the country was headed in. \\u201cI\\u2019m optimistic about where we\\u2019ll end up,\\u201d Bush said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been through these periods before and we\\u2019ve always had a way to come out of it. I\\u2019m more optimistic than some.\\u201d     Trump, the first Republican president since Bush left office, won the November presidential election after beating 16 other candidates to the party\\u2019s nomination, including Bush\\u2019s brother Jeb. Prominent Republicans within the establishment wing of the party, including Bush and his father, former president George H.W. Bush, shunned him or offered tepid support. Bush diverged sharply from Trump\\u2019s new administration in a separate interview with NBC\\u2019s \\u201cToday\\u201d show on Monday, saying he supported a \\u201cwelcoming\\u201d immigration policy and praising the media as \\u201cindispensable to democracy,\\u201d during a wide-ranging interview with NBC\\u2019s \\u201cToday\\u201d show. [nL2N1GC0I1] Bush and his wife Laura spoke to People at their Dallas home. Proceeds from the book, a collection of portraits of wounded veterans, will help fund veterans\\u2019 health care and employment programs\\u00a0at the\\u00a0George W. Bush Presidential Center. The couple told the entertainment magazine that the center\\u2019s immigration ceremonies, reproductive-health programs for women in Africa and leadership training for Muslim women from the Middle East stand in contrast to Trump\\u2019s isolationism.  \\u201cThere\\u2019s\\u00a0a lot of ways to speak out,\\u201d he added. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s really through actions defending the values important to Laura and me. We\\u2019re a blessed nation, and we ought to help others.\\u201d Bush shrugged when People magazine asked if Trump\\u2019s immigration policies could threaten the center\\u2019s programs.   \\u201cNow that you mention it, it might bother me but we\\u2019ll figure out how to bring them over,\\u201d he said. \",\n          \"MOSCOW (Reuters) - There is no cooperation between Russia and U.S. on North Korea for the time being, the RIA news agency cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying on Saturday.

the number of patients they have hospitals will be paid for services through the new system rather than receiving lump sums from regional administrations as is now   it also allows patients to choose their doctor for the first time rather than being tied to the doctor where their residence is registered a move the government says will encourage medics to improve and gives them less scope to demand backhanders health minister ulana suprun said that patients  mindsets will also need to change   people in ukraine think that paying the doctor cash under the table is somehow a  thank you  for the services that are supposed to be provided to them at no cost  she said in an interview  there needs to be a big cultural change as well so that we teach people that they re not supposed to do that   she cited a survey by the national anticorruption bureau which found  percent of ukrainians had come across corruption in the past year of which  percent was in healthcare  and finance minister oleksandr danylyuk told reuters in an email ukraine will hike health spending by  percent to  billion hryvnia  billion in  and is ready for a further increase later because the reform is a government priority ukraine has emerged from a steep recession caused by the annexation of crimea and the outbreak of a russianbacked separatist insurgency in   but the economy is still propped up by a  billion aid program from the international monetary fund that is conditional on reforms and progress in tackling corruption with no end in sight to the conflict in the donbass defense spending accounts for at least  percent of gdp  the ministry of finance is one of our biggest supporters  suprun said of the planned rise in spending   they re big supporters of what we re doing because they re finally going to be able to follow the money all the way down to a patient whereas now we hand money out to hospitals and we don t really know what is done with it at that point   a usborn doctor suprun moved to ukraine in the early days of the maidan demonstrations in november  and wound up treating the gunshot wounds of protesters in the final days of prokremlin leader viktor yanukovich s rule   the reforms went through  amendments while suprun says she was targeted by a smear campaign including by some who  questioned whether she had faked her diploma  the new legislation is just the first step she says  because reform never is easy people don t want to change they re used to the system that there is and there s a lot of people making a lot of money off of this   healthcare professionals told reuters they welcomed the reforms  oleksandr ivanko chief doctor at the kiev municipal clinical hospital hoped doctors  salaries would improve  because you cannot motivate them and demand anything while

completely incoherent rant about things his personal pilot had told him as you can imagine everyone in the room was shocked as trump continued to hijack the meeting and went on babbling making it impossible to actually get anything accomplished until he was finishedaccording to the white house pool report trump commended airlines for succeeding  despite the bad equipment that the airport gives you in many cases  then he started complaining about the equipment stating that he had  a pilot who s a real expert  who once told him that airlines are often given  the wrong stuff  trump continued let s order the right equipment probably the wrong equipment cost more here are some more gems from his rant we want the traveling public to have the greatest customer service and with an absolute minimum of delays we spent six trillion dollars in the middle east we got nothing and we have an obsolete plane system we have obsolete airports as you can imagine most of this rant made zero sense this has become a pattern for trump   he continues to meet with industry ceos but he doesn t actually accomplish anything he doesn t tackle policy and he spends most of his time talking about himself or complaining this shouldn t be too surprising considering that we elected a former reality television star who knows nothing about policy so he s obviously doing whatever he can to pass the time in these meetingsyou can watch trump go completely off track in the meeting belowread morefeatured image via win mcnamee  getty images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

Kennedy Jr. announced at a White House press conference Friday that “becoming an eel is a sign of good health.” “Big Pharma may have brainwashed people to think otherwise, but a healthy human body should be one long, even tube with a fin running down its back,” said the health and human services secretary, who warned that the average American child is now so full of chemicals and preservatives that they no longer secrete enough protective mucus to cover their skin. “Humans have been getting sicker and sicker ever since modern medicine convinced us we need arms and legs. In fact, if we were eating a proper diet of insects, mollusks, and sea urchins instead of this agricultural garbage, we wouldn’t need all these vaccines. You look at the ocean, and there is no autism in there. It’s not conspiratorial thinking to put two and two together. I mean, people are so big these days they can barely slither into a crevasse or burrow in the sand to hide from predators. You might think this yellow-green, slimy skin is a bad sign, but I’ve never felt better—and I’ve never performed better in the bedroom either.” Kennedy added that he would be rescinding all government approval for glasses and contacts, saying healthy people should be able to navigate waterways using their sense of smell.\"\n",

According to sources, the senior administration official provided no word of explanation as he unfurled a hand-drawn blueprint in a corner of the North Lawn, put on a pair of work gloves, and spent hours digging a series of deep holes over which he soon laid a floor equipped with a locking trapdoor. Witnesses confirmed that as the structure took shape, Miller often ran at full speed and slammed his shoulder into the walls to test their sturdiness, and at several points he went inside, closed the door, and screamed as loudly as he could to ensure no sound could escape. When the building was complete, the 39-year-old is said to have reentered the White House and hauled out a number of burlap sacks, each of which appeared to hold something alive and writhing. Miller was then seen tossing the bags in the shed, fastening the door with multiple padlocks, and returning to the West Wing for the remainder of the day.\""
